Implementation Notes for the Neuron Simulation, HTML5 Version
=============================================================

This simulation was ported from a Java version.  As such, there are a number of things that are done in the code that
would likely have been done in a very different manner if this had been written from scratch as in JavaScript.  It is
important to keep this in mind when maintaining this code, since otherwise there are likely to be a lot of moments
where the maintainer is thinking things like, "Why the heck did they do this? I'm going to do it differently!", thus
ending up with a mish-mash of coding styles.

One particular area where this Java vs. JavaScript contrast is apparent is in the use of getters.  In the Java code,
there were many private variables that were accessed through getters.  For the most part, these getters were retained,
even though there is no such thing as a private member variable in JavaScript.  These getter functions look a little
weird in this context, but keeping them made the port easier.
