Model Notes
===========

The underlying model for action potentials depicted in this simulation is a Hodgkin-Huxley model, which is a
mathematical model that was originally developed in the 1950s. Please see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model for more information on this.

The simulation portrays an action potential moving down an axon and ultimately reaching the cross section shown in the
view. The moment when the animated action potential reaches the cross section is the moment when the underlying
Hodgkin-Huxley model is triggered. As the membrance potential changes in the model, selective membrane channels open on
the axon's cross section, and sodium and potassium ions move across the membrane in order to illustrate that it is the
motion of these ions that cause the change in electric potential across the membrane. The number of ions that cross the
membrane is meant to be illustrative, and is obviously far less than the actual number of ions that would cross the
membrane in a real axon.

The charge indicators, which can be turned on using one of the checkboxes on the control panel, are sized
proportionately. As the membrane potential changes, these indicators grow, shrink, and in some cases change from
positive to negative or vice versa.

The cross section also depicts leakage channels, which allow sodium and potassium to cross the membrane in relatively
small amounts at all times.

What is *not* depicted in this simulation is any sort of ion pump. This was deemed to be beyond the scope of the
simulation. This can be used as a good starting point for classroom discussions about how the resting membrane potential
is maintained.
